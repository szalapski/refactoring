  - seven-step DI refactoring in BigBallOfMud.HomeController
  1. (static only) Sequester the untestable/uninjectable code into a tightly-coupled implementation
	a. extract instance method
	b. extract instance class from that method
	c. use the new class and method with "new"
  2. make local refereance for the "new" object only
  3. move local to instance and switch to abstract type (i.e. interface)
  4. bastardize constructor
  5. configure DI
  7. remove bastard constructor
  N. clean up code (always)

  - Kill loops with Linq - GetManageInfo;  GetExternalLogins
    

Things to mention
- Refactoring is not about less typing
- Keyboard shortcuts to learn
  - Ctrl+arrows, ctrl+backspace
